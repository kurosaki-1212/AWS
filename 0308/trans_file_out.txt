Thank you very much for using our software.

The question you received is probably due to a different version of Python.

Is your environment Windows, macOS or Linux?

For Windows, use the “python” command, and for macOS and Linux, use the “Python 3" command.

If you use the “python” command on macOS or Linux, the software may not work as expected because Python 2 is started instead of Python 3.

With the above measures. I hope it resolves the issue.

We thank you for your continued use of our software in the future.
